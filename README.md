# Attune

**Tag your music as it plays.**

Attune is a macOS music tagger app for adding keywords while you listen. It runs
as a lightweight menu bar utility and communicates with the system Music app via
[AppleScript] and [Scripting Bridge]. It uses a keyboard-driven overlay for
fast, forgiving, unobtrusive editing.
