Attune is a macOS music tagger app for adding keywords while you listen to your
local music library. It runs as a lightweight menu bar utility and communicates
with the system Music app via [AppleScript] and [Scripting Bridge]. It uses a
keyboard-driven overlay for fast, forgiving, unobtrusive editing.
